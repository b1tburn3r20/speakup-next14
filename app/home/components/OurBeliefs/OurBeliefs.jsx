              We believe right now politics is a game, a game where there are
              winners and losers and we the people are the losers. The 99% are
              the losers.

              The world is burning and the people who have a voice use their
              voice for making money, selfish pleasures

              Politians are supposed to be the voice of the people. If so why is
              it that each year politicians bully eachother and put eachother
              down on tv advertisements to make themselves look better, once
              elected we forget about them until re-election time as they try
              and convince us that they are a good representation of us
